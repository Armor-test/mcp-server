## üí° Usage Examples
After installing the BrowserStack MCP Server, use the prompts below in your favorite AI clients: Github Copilot, Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.

### üì± Manual App Testing
Use the following prompts to use your **mobile apps** on BrowserStack's extensive cloud of real devices. Stop using emulators!

```bash
# Open app on specific device
"open my app on a iPhone 15 Pro Max"

# Debug app crashes
"My app crashed on Android 14 device, can you help me debug?"
```

- Test your mobile apps on BrowserStack's extensive cloud of real devices
- Unlike emulators, test your app's real-world performance on actual devices
- Debug crashes and performance issues in real-time
- Access all major devices and OS versions from our [device grid](https://www.browserstack.com/list-of-browsers-and-platforms/app_live).


### üåê Manual Web Testing
Similar to the app testing, you can use the following prompts to test your **websites** on BrowserStack's extensive cloud of real browsers and devices. Don't have a Windows machine to test on Internet Explorer? We've got you covered!

```bash
# Test your local websites
"open my website hosted on localhost:3001 on a internet explorer"
```
- Test websites across different browsers and devices. We support all major browsers and devices.
- Seamlessly test websites hosted locally, no need to deploy to a remote server!



### üß™ Automated Testing (Playwright, Selenium, etc.)

Use the following prompts to run/debug/fix your **automated tests** on BrowserStack's [Test Platform](https://www.browserstack.com/test-platform).

```bash
# Port test suite to BrowserStack
"run my test suite on BrowserStack infra"

# Debug test failures
"My test suite failed, can you help me fix the new failures?"

# Accessibility testing
"check for accessibility issues on my www.mywebsite.com"
```

- Fix test failures reported by your CI/CD pipeline by utilising our industry leading [Test Observability](https://www.browserstack.com/docs/test-observability) features. Find more info [here](https://www.browserstack.com/docs/test-observability/features/smart-tags).
- Run tests written in Jest, Playwright, Selenium, and more on BrowserStack's [Test Platform](https://www.browserstack.com/test-platform)

## ‚ú® Supported Features - More Coming Soon!

### üåê Web Testing

### üß™ Automated Testing

## ü§ù Recommended MCP Clients

- **Github Copilot or Cursor** (Recommended for automated testing + debugging)
- **Claude Desktop** (Recommended for manual testing)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- The BrowserStack MCP Server is under active development and currently supports a subset of the MCP protocol, i.e. `tools`. More features will be added soon.
- As tool invocation relies on the MCP Client which in turn rely on LLMs for tool calling. There can be some non-deterministic behaviour and can lead to unexpected results. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please open an issue to discuss.
