## ü§ù Recommended MCP Clients

- **Github Copilot or Cursor** (Recommended for automated testing + debugging)
- **Claude Desktop** (Recommended for manual testing)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- The BrowserStack MCP Server is under active development and currently supports a subset of the MCP protocol, i.e. `tools`. More features will be added soon.
- As tool invocation relies on the MCP Client which in turn rely on LLMs for tool calling. There can be some non-deterministic behaviour and can lead to unexpected results. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please open an issue to discuss.
