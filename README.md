## üí° Usage Examples

### üì± Manual App Testing

Use the following prompts to use your **mobile apps** on BrowserStack's extensive cloud of real devices. Stop using emulators!

```bash
# Open app on specific device
"open my app on a iPhone 15 Pro Max"

# Debug app crashes
"My app crashed on Android 14 device, can you help me debug?"
```

- Unlike emulators, test your app's real-world performance on actual devices. With advanced [App-Profiling features](https://www.browserstack.com/docs/app-live/app-performance-testing), you can debug crashes and performance issues in real-time.
- Access all major devices and OS versions from our [device grid](https://www.browserstack.com/list-of-browsers-and-platforms/app_live), We have strict SLAs to provision our global datacenters with newly released devices on [launch day](https://www.browserstack.com/blog/browserstack-launches-iphone-15-on-day-0-behind-the-scenes/).

### üåê Manual Web Testing

Similar to the app testing, you can use the following prompts to test your **websites** on BrowserStack's extensive cloud of real browsers and devices. Don't have a Windows machine to test on Internet Explorer? We've got you covered!

```bash
# Test your local websites
"open my website hosted on localhost:3001 on Internet Explorer"
```

- Test websites across different browsers and devices. We support [every major browser](https://www.browserstack.com/list-of-browsers-and-platforms/live) across every major OS.
- Seamlessly test websites hosted locally on your machine, no need to deploy to a remote server!

### üß™ Automated Testing (Playwright, Selenium, A11y and more..)

Use the following prompts to run/debug/fix your **automated tests** on BrowserStack's [Test Platform](https://www.browserstack.com/test-platform).

```bash
# Port test suite to BrowserStack
"run my test suite on BrowserStack infra"

# Debug test failures
"My test suite failed, can you help me fix the new failures?"

# Accessibility testing
"check for accessibility issues on my www.mywebsite.com"
```

- Fix test failures reported by your CI/CD pipeline by utilising our industry leading [Test Observability](https://www.browserstack.com/docs/test-observability) features. Find more info [here](https://www.browserstack.com/docs/test-observability/features/smart-tags).
- Run tests written in Jest, Playwright, Selenium, and more on BrowserStack's [Test Platform](https://www.browserstack.com/test-platform)
- **Accessibility Testing**: Ensure WCAG and ADA compliance with our [Accessibility Testing](https://www.browserstack.com/accessibility-testing) tool

## üöÄ Overview

## ü§ù Recommended MCP Clients

- We recommend using **Github Copilot or Cursor** for automated testing + debugging use cases.
- For manual testing use cases (Live Testing), we recommend using **Claude Desktop**.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- The BrowserStack MCP Server is under active development and currently supports a subset of the MCP protocol, i.e. `tools`. More features will be added soon.
- As tool invocation relies on the MCP Client which in turn rely on LLMs for tool calling. There can be some non-deterministic behaviour and can lead to unexpected results. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please open an issue to discuss.
